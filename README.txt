Welcome to MirageSource 5.
---------------------------

This version of Mirage Source has been updated with DirectX 8. The engine itself in regards to its features is much the same as the original version with the added feature of seamless scrolling maps.

If you experience an ActiveX 429 Runtime Error, you may need to register dx8vb.dll. The source code is looking for DLL files mostly in the C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ folder, some versions of windows will have most of these libraries in the System32 folder. You can either open the source code and point to the correct file path, or simply re-register the files again. The DLL files used in this source are contained within the "Libraries" folder, so you can easily copy and paste them.

I do not recommend registering them inside the "Libraries" folder as other VB6 projects you may download later will give you the same issue.

---------------------------

Some anti-virus programs may have an issue with the included .exe files in this release. This can some times happen due to a lack of certificate and the way the server accesses ports on your network. Simply recompile the source code.

The exe's are included for the purpose of testing by individuals who may not currently have access to a compiler.

Mirage Source 5 has been updated by Xlithan.
